      <p>There are so many things I've learned this summer, so I'll try to name a few!</p>
      <p>I learned how to make web pages using HTML and CSS. I started with zero experience, but this program really helped me learn at a surprisingly quick rate. I also learned a lot more on how to use a computer and use folders correctly!</p>

      <p>Now, some of the things I liked about WEB 1400 was that the material wasn't TOO hard, and the teacher assistants were always there whenever you couldn't find a solution.</p>
      <p>I don't exactly have any complaints, but I do believe that the course also lacked teaching us about Javascript. I was pretty eager to know more about it, and I found it more interesting that it actually had to do with the interactability (I think that's a word) of the website.</p>
